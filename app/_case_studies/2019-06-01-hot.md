  title: HOT is transforming the way we map the world for humanitarian disaster relief.
  description: |
    When major disaster strikes anywhere in the world, thousands of HOT volunteers come together online and on the ground to create open map data that enables disaster responders to reach those in need. 


    The Tasking Manager, built by HOTOSM is the leading tool to coordinate mapping projects in OpenStreetMap. Through the Tasking Manager, mapping projects can be created and split into  tasks allowing for more collaboration, quicker mapping and faster help for people in need.

    title: Understanding the people behind the screens
    content: |

      We started the project with a deep discovery phase. We wanted to understand the needs and motivations of the different users of the Tasking Manager â€” from volunteer mappers, to experienced mappers, from validators to project managers.
 

      Through user interviews, data analysis, usability and userflows analysis, hours of HOTJAR session recordings, attending a Mapathon and running a stakeholders workshop, we managed to create a complete view of the Tasking Manager and opportunies for improvement.

    title: Design Opportunities - turning goals into actions
    content: |
      Our research showed low user engagement and retention with TM, evidenced by the low rate of user return and newcomers. On top of that, the learning curve of the tool was steep, and there was no user support system, making the user feel helpless and without any sense of accomplishment.

      The solution was sustained over the following key elements: enhance homepage story-telling, create a support system, improve project listing page user experience, optimize the project page,  provide communication tools and add a gamification layer.

    title: Storytelling for deeper impact
    content: |
      For the homepage our goal to tell a story. Not the tasking manager story, but the stories of all the people whose lives are improved by mapping efforts. 

      We wanted to ensure users perceive the real impact of mapping rather than focus on features, and show how easy it is to collaborate on a project even if you don't have previous experience.

    title: Streamline decision making
    content: |
      Research showed that users were having a hard time choosing a project to map, navigating through multiple projects and tasks before making a decision or eventually abandoning the process without mapping. 

      We redesigned the project listing, project cards and filtering system to make it easier to select a project.  Mappers can view projects by cause, urgency, organization, country or their own mapping skills, narrowing down their choice to the best individual option.

      Project cards provide a summary of all the information needed for a mapper to choose a project to contribute.

      Information is displayed in a way that is easy to read and understand.

    title: Improved UX with Machine Learning
    content: |
      The Tasking Manager validation/mapping process was divided across two different platforms - Tasking Manager and IdEditor - which was creating entropy and making it harder for the user to complete the process. To smooth the process, we designed a single work environment that is straightforward and much more efficient. 

      The major and most significant improvement was bringing machine learning into the equation. Doing so enabled mappers to be assigned a task that matched their skill level and time constraints - preventing errors, reducing drop-off, and promoting a more rewarding user experience.

      To boost user engagement as well as conversion rates, we decided to add a little fun and healthy competition to tasking manager. People enjoy more playful and competitive activities similar to video games, so they are encouraged to come back.

      To measure mappers activity and success, Tasking manager started using a challenge & reward  system. When completing tasks, users are awarded points and badges, it is through these points that they can progress in their career as a mapper (beginner, intermediate, advanced), leading to promotion to validator role. All these scores are public, and not only are shown in the user's profile but also in a overall Leaderboard.

    title: Improved communication
    content: |
      Feedback keeps users in the loop and make them feel part of the experience.

      Mapping is not always an easy matter and there may be many doubts during the process. Users reported a lack of feedback and support not only from the TM tool itself but also from more experienced mappers, project managers and validators. In order to fill this lacuna, we' have designed an FAQ and a tutorials page and also one In-app notifications & message tool. 

      This allows users to communicate swiftly - praise and support each other - creating a more friendly and rewarding work environment.
