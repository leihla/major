    title: Making sense of content
    content: |
      The first thing we did was take inventory of the last year data and set out to bring consistency to all the information being displayed.

      As they had a huge variety of results - numbers, percentages, text, charts, tables - this was a core problem we needed to address.

    title: Enhanced user experience through card-based design
    content: |
      Each insight is delivered by completely self-contained card which maintain the same content structure, only differing in color by topic. It looks clean and tidy.
      Using a card-based layout makes easier for the user quickly scan the page and comprehend
      the information.

      One of the biggest advantages of cards is that they are easily scaled up or down, allowing us to design a single aesthetic across multiple devices and to secure a consistent experience regardless of the device.

      We used satellite images instead of vectors because they provide the user with a more vivid geographic understanding of the country – borders, coast, environment – e ao mesmo tempo dão um tah-dah effect.

    title: Quick and easy navigation
    content: |
      As we dug deeper, it became evident that users would want to navigate through the content by sections. Instead finding the desired content by scrolling down, we opted for a more convenient user experience: housing indicators in a sticky navigation and section anchors, keeping data indicators in easy reach and enabling them to jump between them very quickly.
